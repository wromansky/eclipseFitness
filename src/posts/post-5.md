Kevin is awesome! They helped me gain some serious weight on my lifts and helped me get my diet check in check. If you are hesitant on getting a trainer don’t be it’s worth it and they are more than happy to work with you to make sure you are able to reach your goals. Bench started at 265 lbs and 16 weeks later it is now at 305 lbs. Squat went from 345 lbs to over 405lbs. Deadlift went from 345 lbs to 495 lbs. All in just 16 weeks!
